# Sprint x Report 
Video Link: 
## What's New (User Facing)
 * Users can create study groups
 * Users can access a study group and send messages
 * Users can create an account and login

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
This sprint, we were tasked with making groups that users could access based on an ID. We also had to allow users to enter a group and send a message which showed who sent it, when it was sent, and the contents of the message. We also needed to handle how to load the messages of a group chat when the group was entered. 

## Unfinished Work
We did not finish the group search and join functionality. This sprint, we were mainly focused on allowing users to create groups, access groups, and send messages, but we were unable to get a search and join due to time constraints. Related to this, we also weren't able to have users access groups based on their classes listed in canvas. This will be implemented while we implement the search and join feature.
