Simply run the docker-compose.yaml file to build and run the backend alongside the frontend containers:
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml up

Note that the links listed will not lead anywhere. Instead,
type in http://localhost:5000/ (backend) or http://localhost:3000/ (frontend) in the browser to access the containers.

Also, for code changes to be seen, the command will need to be rerun so that the changes can be seen.
