# Chosen Topic: StudyGroup
StudyGroup is a platform that helps university students form and manage study groups
based on their courses and academic interests. The system will allow students to create
or join study groups, schedule study sessions, and share resources. A database will store
group information, schedules, and shared materials. Integration with the university
course system will allow for automatic suggestions of study groups based on enrolled
courses.
