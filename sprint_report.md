# Sprint x Report 
Video Link: 
## What's New (User Facing)
 * Users can enter a username and password on the frontend
 * Users can navigate to the "Canvas" page and enter their Personal Access Token to load their current class names as they appear in Canvas
 * Users are able to enter a username and password and have it stored and retrieved on the backend
 * Users have a profile that they are able to modify

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
During this sprint, our team learned new tools such as Svelte, Django, and postgresQL in order to manage data, make API calls, and provide a smooth web app experience. In order to make the canvas data call, we had to communciate with the Canvas LMS API. We used this to view enrolled courses and filter the courses based on access and enrollment status such as student, professor, or TA. In order to access the data, we need the user to generate an access token through their Canvas settings. Having access through a secure login would be ideal but requires access granted by system admins at WSU. We also created a frontend and backend for the username and password authentication feature which is essential for user profiles. The other feature completed was the ability for users to have and edit their user profile data such as a bio and name.

## Unfinished Work
We did not finish integrating the frontend with the backend or any of the issues together. This was because we were sometimes stuck with some members having easy tasks and others having more difficult ones that required learning tools they were unfamiliar with. Another unfinished issue is the entering of access tokens in order to display canvas classes. These issues will be added to the next sprint and be completed earlier on with more check-ins.
