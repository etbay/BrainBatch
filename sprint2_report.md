# Sprint 2 Report 
Video Link: 
## What's New (User Facing)
 * Users can create study groups
 * Users can access a study group and send messages
 * Users can create an account and login

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
This sprint we focused on group creation and chatting. We mainly spent time attempting to learn about how to setup Supabase, Digital Ocean, and Flask. We were able to successfully setup and use Supabase, alongside create a Digital Ocean account. Flask has been looked into, however nothing major has been done with it yet. Overall, we have established a foundation in for the server side logic and UI to further expand upon in sprint 3.

## Unfinished Work
We did not finish the group search and join functionality. This sprint, we were mainly focused on allowing users to create groups, access groups, and send messages, but we were unable to get a search and join due to time constraints. Related to this, we also weren't able to have users access groups based on their classes listed in canvas. This will be implemented while we implement the search and join feature. We were also unable to finish linking the frontend and backend (fb). Some of us were a little confused on what to do for it, but we do thankfully now know about how we can use Flask to do this. We plan to complete this assignment in sprint 3.

 ## Incomplete Issues/User Stories
 Here are links to issues we worked on but did not complete in this sprint:
 
 * [Search and join group](https://github.com/etbay/BrainBatch/issues/28) - Not completed since we focused more on creation, authentication, and chat messaging for groups and ran out of time

## Retrospective Summary
Here's what went well:
  * We were able to easily create the group creation and messaging.
  * We were able to discuss and plan how we can use CI/CD and Docker for the future since we learned it in class.
  * We were able to find out what to do for the frontend and backend connection.
 
Here's what we'd like to improve:
   * Working more consistently during the weeks (hopefully we'll be good since there'll be less exams).
   * Informing each other of what to for specific assignments.
   * We'd also like to improve our meeting quality, and make them more collaborative alongside efficient.
  
Here are changes we plan to implement in the next sprint:
   * More fully complete user UI.
   * Proper Flask implementation with Python for backend API.
   * Hosting of site on Digital Ocean.
